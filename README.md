# Godot First Person Shooter Demo
A project I made while following the FPS tutorial of Zenva. \
All assets in this project are made by me except the weapons and ammo are made by Kenney ( cuz I don't have too much knowledge about them ). \
You can use them without credit but I'd appreciate it if you do!

# Control:
WASD or Arrow keys to move. \
Space to jump. \
Left mouse button to shoot. \
Scroll wheel to change weapons. 

# Features:
You can pick Ammo pack or Health pack to get more ammos or health.
